## ✏️ABOUT ME
I spend a large portion of my time researching and practicing my craft. For me coding is not only a way to make a living. It's one of my favorite hobbies. I am constantly finding new ways to make my code more compact as well as more efficient. I am also a big fan of leetcode, so I am always on the lookout for algorithms to achieve that O(log n) complexity that everyone dreams about. 

## ✏️HOW IT ALL STARTED
I started my journey with coding back in middle school when I decided to learn how to design interactive websites in HTML5. I then transitioned over to making games in unity in C#. Ever since then I have been taking on various projects and learning how to use my abilities in new and exciting ways.

## ✏️MY HOBBIES
The time I am not allocating towards practicing programming I usually spend tinkering with my car or playing guitar. I drive a 98' honda accord and hopefully this summer I'll finally make the swap to a more powerful engine. As with everything it will take a lot of time and effort, but improvements are what I am all about :)
